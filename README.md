# Podium front end code challenge
Details about the challenge TBD


## Setup and installation

This application is built with [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) and uses a [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) built around [the movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

To get started, ensure you have the correct dependencies installed and run the following commands:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn start`

This will kick off two processes, the JSON server at [http://localhost:2022](http://localhost:2022) and the React server at [http://localhost:2021](http://localhost:2021). 

## TODO: Add docs on server and stuff
